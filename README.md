## Project Overview

The sales data analyst project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Sources**: The project utilizes sales data from multiple sources, including CSV files, databases, or online services.

2. **Power BI Reports**: Power BI reports are used to visualize and analyze the sales data. The reports include various charts, graphs, and dashboards to present key metrics and trends.

3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Data cleaning and transformation techniques are applied to prepare the raw data for analysis. This may include removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data types.

4. **Data Analysis**: The project includes in-depth analysis of the sales data to identify trends, patterns, and insights. Analysis may involve calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), conducting trend analysis, and segmenting data.

5. **Visualization**: Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations that allow stakeholders to explore the sales data dynamically. Visualizations include bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps.
